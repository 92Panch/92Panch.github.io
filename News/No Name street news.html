<h1>New store was opened on the <em>No Name Street</em> </h1>
<p>In the 18:00 pm was opened new store. The name of this store is <q>HAPPY CHOOSE</q>. In this store you can buy everything your heart desires.</br>
We interviewed the designer of this store and below you can see his answer:</br></p>
 <blockquote><q>It was very difficult because the design of this building is very unusual. You know that in order to interest a potential buyer to come into this store, this store has to be visually pleasing and at the same time mysterious.</q></blockquote>
